# Implementation of Sorting Algorithms

This project is an implementation of most sorting algorithms. For now, it only works on integers. In the future, it's planned to work on generic types and objects.

## Implemented Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Counting Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Selection Sort

... And more to come.
